PRD: SmartDynamic - AI-Powered 
Context -Aware Dynamic Pricing System 
(VS Code Development)  
Objective  
To develop a VS Code -based dynamic pricing system that uses machine learning, reinforcement 
learning, and explainable AI to optimize e -commerce pricing in real -time.  
Use Case  
Target Industry: E -commerce  
Users: Pricing Analysts, Product Managers, Data Scientists  
Key Features  
- Demand Forecasting using ML/DL  
- Price Elasticity Modeling  
- RL-based Optimal Pricing  
- Customer Segmentation  
- Competitor Price Scraping  
- Psychological Pricing (₹499 vs ₹500)  
- Weather/Event Context -Aware Pricing  
- Explainability using SHAP  
- Real -time Streamlit App  
- FastAPI Backend for model inference

Tech Stack  
- Python, Pandas, Scikit -learn, XGBoost, Prophet, LSTM (Keras)  
- Stable -Baselines3 (Reinforcement Learning)  
- SHAP, LIME (Explainability)  
- Streamlit (Frontend UI)  
- FastAPI (Backend API)  
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB (Storage)  
- Docker (for containerization)  
- VS Code with extensions: Python, Jupyter, Pylance, GitLens  
Functional Requirements  
- Train ML models for demand forecasting  
- Build RL environment and agent  
- Create API to serve pricing predictions  
- Build Streamlit app for UI interaction  
- Use SHAP for model explanation  
- Integrate external signals (weather, events)  
Non -Functional Requirements
